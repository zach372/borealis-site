  <h1>Borealis Appointments</h1>

  <p>
   Borealis provides B2B outbound sales support services for SEO agencies.

We help clients manage prospect research, outreach strategy, messaging, and ongoing follow-up as part of a structured outbound sales process.

Services are delivered on a monthly subscription basis and focus on supporting our clients’ internal sales efforts through consistent outbound execution and optimization.

We work exclusively with business clients and do not guarantee specific outcomes or results, as performance depends on multiple external factors.

Engagements are ongoing professional services. Payments are non-refundable once a service period begins. After the initial service term, clients may cancel with notice via email.
